# ‚öôÔ∏è Transactions, Storage Layout & Guarantees in Kafka

> How Kafka ensures **atomic writes**, **data visibility**, and **durability** under the hood.  
> Think: ‚ÄúCommit markers, log segments, isolation, and transactional state.‚Äù

## üîÅ Transactional Client & Atomicity

Kafka‚Äôs transactions let you group **writes + offset commits** into a single atomic operation.  
That means either *all* writes + offsets are applied, or *none* of them are visible.  

**How it works**
- A **transaction coordinator** (on a broker) manages global `BeginTransaction`, `CommitTransaction`, and `AbortTransaction` operations.  
- During commit, Kafka appends **COMMIT markers** to all affected partitions (data + offset topics).  
- Until that marker is visible, messages remain hidden from `read_committed` consumers.  
- Aborted or incomplete transactions are skipped.  
- Duplicate writes are prevented via **producer IDs (PIDs)** and **sequence numbers**.

## üóÑÔ∏è Storage Layout: Logs, Segments & Markers

Kafka stores data in **append-only logs**, divided into **segment files** (commonly ~1 GB each).  
New messages append to the active segment; once full, a new segment begins.  
Kafka flushes segments to disk based on size or time thresholds to guarantee durability.

**Transactions add control records to the same log:**
- `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ABORT` markers define transaction boundaries.  
- Consumers in `read_committed` mode only see messages up to the **Last Stable Offset (LSO)** ‚Äî i.e., all messages before the most recent fully committed transaction.  
- Uncommitted messages beyond LSO are invisible until a commit or abort marker appears.

Transactional metadata is persisted in Kafka‚Äôs internal topic:  
`__transaction_state`, replicated and guarded by `min.insync.replicas`.

## üîç Isolation & Read Modes

Kafka consumers control visibility using the `isolation.level` setting:

| Isolation Level | Behavior | Use When |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| `read_uncommitted` | Reads everything ‚Äî even uncommitted or aborted messages | Low-latency or best-effort workloads |
| `read_committed` | Only sees committed data (‚â§ LSO) | For correctness and data consistency |

Commit markers and the **Last Stable Offset (LSO)** guarantee that `read_committed` consumers only see finalized transactions.

## üß≠ Transaction Flow ‚Äî From Producer to Consumer

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Producer (txn-enabled)
    participant CO as Txn Coordinator (broker)
    participant TP as Topic Partition
    participant OFS as Offsets Topic (consumer group)
    participant C as Consumer (read_committed)

    P->>CO: BeginTransaction
    P->>TP: Write records (txn)
    TP-->>P: Acknowledge writes
    P->>CO: CommitTransaction
    CO->>TP: Append COMMIT marker - control record
    CO->>OFS: Write offset commit - atomic with data
    Note over TP,C: LSO advances - committed data now visible
    TP-->>C: Fetch records <= LSO
```

üß© What This Shows

‚Ä¢	Producers begin a transaction, write data, and commit via the coordinator. <br>
‚Ä¢	The coordinator appends commit markers to both topic and offset partitions.<br>
‚Ä¢	Once commit markers are replicated, the LSO advances.<br>
‚Ä¢	read_committed consumers fetch only up to the LSO, skipping in-flight data.<br>

üóÇÔ∏è Storage Layout ‚Äî Segments, Control Records & LSO
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph PART["Kafka Topic Partition<br>(Append-Only Log)"]
      S0["Segment 000<br>(Old committed data)"]
      S1["Segment 001<br>(Active segment)"]
      S2["Segment 002<br>(New writes +<br>Control records)"]
    end

    S0 --> S1 --> S2

    CM["Control Record<br>(COMMIT marker)"]
    S2 --> CM

    LSO["LSO<br>(Last Stable Offset)"]
    HW["HW / LEO<br>(High Watermark /<br>Replication point)"]

    CM --> LSO
    S2 --> HW

```

Mental model
‚Ä¢	Kafka‚Äôs log is immutable and append-only. ‚Ä¢	
‚Ä¢	Transaction markers live in-line with data.‚Ä¢	
‚Ä¢	The LSO marks the end of fully committed data.‚Ä¢	
‚Ä¢	The High Watermark (HW) ensures durability via replication, but doesn‚Äôt control visibility.‚Ä¢

### üì¶ Guarantees & Trade-Offs
| Guarantee                       | Mechanism                                            | Trade-Off                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Exactly-once (within Kafka)** | Transactions + idempotent producers + commit markers | Slightly higher latency + coordination overhead |
| **Durability**                  | Append-only logs + replication + flush policies      | Higher I/O and disk usage                       |
| **Ordering**                    | Per-partition sequencing                             | No cross-partition order                        |
| **Atomic visibility**           | Commit markers + LSO gating                          | Complexity in commit & abort logic              |

### üí° Practical Notes & Tips
‚Ä¢	Transactions cover Kafka ‚Üí Kafka operations (writes + offset commits). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To include external systems (databases, APIs), use idempotent sinks or an Outbox pattern.<br>
‚Ä¢	The internal topic __transaction_state must meet min.insync.replicas to start transactions.<br>
‚Ä¢	Shorter transaction timeouts reduce risk of stalls but increase commit frequency.<br>
‚Ä¢	Key metrics to monitor:
   - txn-commit-time-ns-total<br>
   - EndTxn request rates<br>
   - Transaction abort rates<br>
   - Consumer lag vs LSO<br>

### üß© Recap

Kafka achieves atomicity, durability, and visibility control without distributed locks ‚Äî
instead, it leverages append-only logs, control markers, and offset boundaries.

| LSO (Last Stable Offset) | Visibility marker              | Controls what `read_committed` consumers see |
| Log Segments             | Sequential append files        | Durable, high-throughput storage             |
